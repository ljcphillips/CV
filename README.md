I am a software developer with a background in project management and small business consultancy. I pride myself on my grit and determination and I love finding solutions to stubborn and complex problems. Unsurprisingly, a successful debugging session brings me great joy and is one of my favourite things about programming! 

## Skills

#### Communication

My communication skills were really put to the test when I did complaint handling for a home care agency. I learnt how important it was to listen well and communicate clearly when speaking to frustrated service users and their advocates. I was able to diffuse tense situations and managed to increase retention rates by improving the customer complaints procedure.

#### Project Management

One of my favourite projects was transitioning a company from a paper based timesheet system to an electronic call monitoring(ECM) one, where staff used mobile devices and RFID tags to sign in and out. It was a local authority requirement for the business to have 90% usage of the ECM system. I learnt how important it was to get full buy in from key stakeholders in order to effectively implement this change. Using project management principles(PRINCE2) I was able to bring staff usage of the system up to the 90% threshold within three months. 

#### Flexibility

Shortly after starting my role at my last job, I was advised to grow my team and hire new Account Managers as we were expecting an influx of new customers. Only 3 weeks later, due to an unexpected funding fall through, I was advised that we would need to cut back and members of my team along with lots of other staff would need to be made redundant. It was a challenging time for all and morale was low but I was able to keep the remainder of my team motivated and restructure our workload so that the level of service to our customers did not change.
